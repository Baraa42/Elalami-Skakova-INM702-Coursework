# Task Objectif : Study 2+ factors that affect the performance and interpretation of Linear Regression analysis

## The factors that we could study are : 

- Outliers.
- Normalization of covariates.
- Compare nested models.
- Correlation between the covariates (multicollinearity).
- Presence of hidden confounders.
- Selection bias.
- Model mismatch.

## What we could study for each factor : 

- Distribution (mean and variance) of the estimated coefficients.
- Distribution (mean and variance) of the estimated residuals (errors).
- Dependence of the estimated coefficients and residuals on : 
  - Distribution of certain noise variables.
  - Distribution of other covariates.
  - Form of the true model.
- Comparison of the coefficient and residuals across configurations of the true model.


## First things first : 

We need to choose the 2 factors to study, i haven't checked all of them but i would like to start with __outliers__, it seems easy and then we can build on that ?

## Second things second :

Having choosed the factors, how do we actually study them ? We need to see what kind of dataset to generate etc ... to be continued
